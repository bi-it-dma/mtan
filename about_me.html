            <h1>How my Fitness journey began</h1>
            <h3>After growing up in a household where food was never remotely healthy, where I either got what my sick and single mother could conjure up in 10 minutes or straight-up junk food, I, of course,
                kept gaining weight and was already considered rather overweight at around 8 years of age. Since that sort of food was what I was used to eating,
                it gave me comfort when nothing else went right. <br>

                I kept doing that since my weight and looks never bothered me until I weighed 140 kg back when I was 17 years old. <br>
                Every form of reflection of myself made me feel nothing but deep disgust and hate for myself, which is why I started working out and dieting with
                methods that, in retrospect, weren't just unhealthy but also came with deficiencies and even hormonal issues. <br>

                But I still believe that I can count myself lucky for going through my errors because these are what I could learn from. <br>
                It's incredible how one's life can turn around through dieting and exercising. <br>
                I've gone through what I had to go through, and now I want to give others the help and advice I needed back then, with the experience I have gained since then.
