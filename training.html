                <p>Generally, you can base the Frequency on your current situation and just listen to your body.
                    You have the time and want to workout every day? sure go ahead, you only have 1/2/3/ days? thats fine, 
                    all you need is a good workout plan that allows you to enjoy yourself and to train your full body (optimally twice)
                    in seven days. <br>
                    (but can differ to individual needs and its completely fine if life doesnt allow you to train everything twice).
